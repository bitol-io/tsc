## Summary

This RFC proposes adding support for **measures** and **dimensions** to ODCS by extending the existing `properties` array with a new optional `implementationType` field. A property can be a `column` (default), a `measure` (aggregated value, e.g., `SUM(revenue)`), or a `dimension` (categorical attribute for grouping/filtering). This allows data contracts to express business metrics as first-class properties, reusing all existing property fields, so they can be consumed consistently across reporting, analytics, and AI tools.

Synonyms, originally proposed as part of this RFC, have been factored out into [RFC-0041](0041-synonyms.md) so they apply uniformly to any named object (columns, schemas, output ports, data products) rather than only to measures and dimensions.

## Motivation

### Why are we doing this?

Data contracts today describe the physical and logical structure of data (schemas, properties, types, quality rules) but do not capture the **semantic meaning of business metrics**. Organizations commonly define KPIs like "Total Revenue", "Average Basket Value", or "Number of Orders" — these are computed from underlying properties using aggregations and groupings. Without a standard representation, each team or tool reinvents these definitions, leading to inconsistent metrics across dashboards, reports, and AI-driven insights.

### Use cases

1. **Consistent metric definitions**: A data contract owner defines "Total Revenue = SUM(revenue_euros)" once. All downstream tools (BI, AI assistants, data catalogs) consume the same definition.
2. **Semantic layer interoperability**: Tools like Databricks Metric Views, dbt Semantic Layer, and others define metrics in proprietary formats. ODCS can serve as a portable, tool-agnostic interchange format.
3. **Self-service analytics**: Data consumers can discover available measures and dimensions from the contract without needing to understand the underlying SQL or table structure.
4. **AI/LLM readability**: Business names and (via [RFC-0041](0041-synonyms.md)) synonyms help AI assistants understand what a metric means in business terms, enabling natural language querying.

### Alignment with guiding values

- **We favor a small standard over a large one**: This RFC adds a single optional field (`implementationType`) to existing properties. No new top-level structures are introduced. Advanced features (joins, grains, materialization) are left to tool-specific extensions via `customProperties`.
- **We favor interoperability over readability**: The design is compatible with Databricks Metric Views, dbt metrics, and similar semantic layer tools, enabling import/export between ODCS and these tools.

## Design and examples

### Core concept

Measures and dimensions are **properties**. Rather than introducing new top-level arrays, this RFC adds an optional `implementationType` field to existing properties. This means measures and dimensions inherit all existing property fields (`name`, `logicalType`, `logicalTypeOptions`, `businessName`, `description`, `transformLogic`, `customProperties`, `authoritativeDefinitions`, etc.) with zero duplication.

### New fields

#### `implementationType` (optional, string, on properties)

Specifies how the property is implemented. One of:

| Value       | Description                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `column`    | A physical column in the underlying data store. **This is the default** — if `implementationType` is omitted, the property is a column.                                           |
| `measure`   | An aggregated value computed via a SQL aggregation expression (e.g., `SUM(revenue)`, `COUNT(DISTINCT order_id)`). The `transformLogic` field contains the aggregation expression. |
| `dimension` | A categorical attribute used for grouping and filtering. The `transformLogic` field contains the SQL expression or property reference.                                            |

### Example 1: Minimal — a single measure and dimension

A simple e-commerce contract with one revenue measure and one dimension, alongside regular column properties.

```yaml
apiVersion: v3.2.0
kind: DataContract
id: turnover-metrics
name: Turnover Metrics

schema:
  - name: orders
    physicalName: fact_orders
    properties:
      - name: order_id
        logicalType: string
        primaryKey: true
      - name: revenue_euros
        logicalType: number
      - name: country_code
        logicalType: string
      - name: country_code_dim
        implementationType: dimension
        logicalType: string
        transformLogic: country_code
        description: "Country where the order was placed"
      - name: total_revenue
        implementationType: measure
        logicalType: number
        transformLogic: SUM(revenue_euros)
        description: "Total revenue in Euros"
```

### Example 2: Detailed — turnover metrics with formatting and computed measures

> The `synonyms` entries shown below are defined by [RFC-0041](0041-synonyms.md); they are included here to illustrate how measures and dimensions compose with synonyms in a realistic contract.

        businessName: Average Basket Value
        synonyms:
          - name: ABV
            source: glossary
```

### Example 3: Dimension with a SQL expression

Dimensions can use SQL expressions in `transformLogic`, not just direct property references.

```yaml
    properties:
      # ... columns omitted for brevity ...
      - name: order_month
        implementationType: dimension
        logicalType: date
        transformLogic: DATE_TRUNC('MONTH', order_date)
        description: "Month of the order"
        businessName: Order Month
      - name: order_status_label
        implementationType: dimension
        logicalType: string
        transformLogic: |
          CASE
            WHEN order_status = 'O' THEN 'Open'
            WHEN order_status = 'P' THEN 'Processing'
            WHEN order_status = 'F' THEN 'Fulfilled'
          END
        description: "Human-readable order status"
        businessName: Order Status
```

### Compatibility with Databricks Metric Views

The proposed structure maps to Databricks Metric Views YAML. In Databricks, measures and dimensions are separate arrays; in ODCS, they are unified as properties distinguished by `implementationType`:

| ODCS property field                | Databricks Metric View field |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `implementationType: dimension`    | entry in `dimensions[]`      |
| `implementationType: measure`      | entry in `measures[]`        |
| `name`                             | `name`                       |
| `transformLogic`                   | `expr`                       |
| `description`                      | `comment`                    |
| `businessName`                     | `display_name`               |
| `logicalTypeOptions`               | `format`                     |

ODCS reuses existing property field names (`transformLogic`, `businessName`, `logicalType`, `logicalTypeOptions`) for consistency with the rest of the standard, while Databricks uses its own naming (`expr`, `display_name`, `format`). ODCS uses `camelCase` per convention; Databricks uses `snake_case`.

Synonym interoperability with Databricks Metric Views is covered by [RFC-0041](0041-synonyms.md).

### Discussion: naming of the new field

The TSC approved the **concept** on 2026-05-19 but did not settle on the field name. After eliminating weaker candidates (`propertyType`, `role`, `kind`, `propertyRole`, `semanticRole`, `propertyImplementation`, `category` / `propertyCategory`, `type`), the TSC narrowed the choice to six finalists, listed here in no particular order:

- `usageType`
- `interpretationType`
- `reportingType`
- `metricType`
- `semanticType`
- `implementationType`

The key semantic is: "what role does this property play — a physical column, an aggregated measure, or a grouping dimension?" A vote on the final name will be held at the next TSC meeting. Community input is welcome on the dedicated Slack channel.

## Alternatives

### Alternative A: Separate `measures` and `dimensions` arrays at the schema level (rejected)

Add two new arrays (`measures` and `dimensions`) alongside `properties` at the schema level, each with their own field definitions.

**Rejected because**: Measures and dimensions are conceptually properties — they have names, types, descriptions, business names, and transform logic, just like columns. Creating separate arrays would duplicate the property schema and require maintaining parallel field definitions. Using `implementationType` on existing properties is simpler and more consistent with the guiding value of favoring a small standard.

### Alternative B: Reuse the `quality` block for metrics (rejected)

Express measures as data quality rules with a special type.

**Rejected because**: Measures are fundamentally different from quality checks. Quality checks validate data; measures aggregate data for business consumption. Overloading `quality` would confuse semantics and make tool interoperability harder.

### Alternative C: Use `customProperties` only (rejected)

Store measures and dimensions as custom properties without standardized fields.

**Rejected because**: This defeats the purpose of a standard. Every tool would use different property names, making interoperability impossible. The guiding value "we favor interoperability over readability" demands a standardized structure.

### Alternative D: Include joins and source in ODCS (rejected for now)

Databricks Metric Views support `source`, `joins`, and `filter` at the metric view level.

**Rejected for now because**: ODCS already defines schema structure, servers, and relationships (via RFC-0013, RFC-0026b). Adding a parallel join/source mechanism would duplicate existing capabilities. The `transformLogic` field in measures and dimensions can reference properties defined in the schema. Cross-schema joins could be addressed in a follow-up RFC if needed, keeping this RFC small per our guiding values.

## Decision

The **concept** was approved by the TSC on 2026-05-19 for inclusion in ODCS v3.2.0. The **field name** was not settled and will be put to a vote at the next TSC meeting, narrowed to six finalists: `usageType`, `interpretationType`, `reportingType`, `metricType`, `semanticType`, `implementationType` — see "Discussion: naming of the new field" above. The RFC will be promoted to `approved/odcs-v3.2.0/` once the name is ratified.

## Consequences

- **Non-breaking change**: `implementationType` is an optional field on properties. Existing contracts remain valid — all current properties are implicitly `implementationType: column`.
- **No schema duplication**: Measures and dimensions reuse the full property schema (name, logicalType, logicalTypeOptions, businessName, description, transformLogic, customProperties, authoritativeDefinitions, etc.).
- **Tool interoperability**: Tools supporting Databricks Metric Views, dbt Semantic Layer, or similar can import/export measures and dimensions via ODCS.
- **Schema evolution**: Future RFCs may extend this with joins across schemas, filter expressions, or grain definitions, building on this foundation.
- **ODPS alignment**: A follow-up RFC could bring the same structure to ODPS for data product metric definitions.

## Appendix: Vendor Landscape for Measures and Dimensions

The concept of measures and dimensions is central to the semantic layer ecosystem. This appendix catalogs vendors and tools that define or consume measures and dimensions, demonstrating the broad industry need for a standardized, portable representation.

### Summary

The measures-and-dimensions pattern is a universal concept across the entire data analytics stack — from warehouse-native implementations (Databricks, Snowflake) to standalone semantic layers (dbt, Cube, AtScale) to BI tools (Power BI, Tableau, Looker, Superset). Adding measures and dimensions to ODCS positions the standard at the center of this ecosystem, enabling data contracts to serve as a portable, tool-agnostic semantic interchange format.

| 2026-05-19 | Jean-Georges Perrin                                                   | TSC approved the **concept** for ODCS v3.2.0; the **field name** was not ratified. Narrowed naming candidates to six finalists (`usageType`, `interpretationType`, `reportingType`, `metricType`, `semanticType`, `implementationType`) for a vote at the next TSC meeting. RFC stays in `tsc/rfcs/` until the name is settled. Deduplicated RFC-0041 pointers and trimmed Example 1. |
| 2026-04-21 | Jean-Georges Perrin                                                   | Split `synonyms` out of this RFC into [RFC-0041](0041-synonyms.md) following the TSC meeting on 2026-04-21. Removed the `synonyms` field definition and its discussion item; kept `synonyms` in Example 2 with a pointer to RFC-0041 to show how measures/dimensions compose with synonyms. Updated Summary, Use cases, Alignment-with-guiding-values, RFC-0038 note, Databricks compatibility table, and Consequences. No change to `implementationType` or its values.                                                                                                             |

Two candidate shapes — array of strings vs. array of objects — are now presented as a TSC discussion item. The WG recommends the object form (with fields `id`, `name`, `description`, `locale`, `source`, `status`, `customProperties`); the rest of the RFC assumes that recommendation is adopted. |
