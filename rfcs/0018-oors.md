## Summary

Provide an easy mechanism to exchange observability results.

## Motivation

A simpler format like OORS (Open Observability Results Standard) is useful because it reduces the complexity of capturing and sharing essential observability data across systems. By focusing on clarity, portability, and ease of implementation, OORS enables teams to communicate operational results—such as SLAs, uptime, latency, and data freshness—without requiring deep observability expertise or complex infrastructure. It supports consistent reporting and automation across the data lifecycle, making it easier to track the health and performance of data products. As an open format developed within the Bitol community, OORS is lightweight, human-readable, following the same philosophy as OCDS & ODPS, and designed to integrate naturally into existing data workflows, while remaining independent and adaptable to various environments.

OpenTelemetry is a powerful and flexible observability framework, but it comes with challenges such as a steep learning curve, complex configuration, and evolving support for logs. It lacks a plug-and-play experience, requiring manual setup and integration, especially for legacy systems or vendor exporters. Operational overhead, data volume concerns, and potential resource consumption can add to complexity, while security and governance features must be implemented externally. Despite these drawbacks, its vendor-neutral approach and growing ecosystem make it a strong choice for organizations willing to invest in proper implementation.

## Design and examples

> This is the bulk of the RFC.
> Explain the design in enough detail for somebody familiar with data contracts and the standard to understand. This should get into specifics and corner-cases, and include examples of how this is to be used.
> Offer at least two examples, one is minimalist, one is more structured.

## Alternatives

> Rejected alternative solutions and the reasons why.

## Decision

> The decision made by the TSC.

## Consequences

> The consequences of this decision.

## References

> Prior art, inspiration, and other references you used to create this based on what's worked well before.
