# Open Data Product Standard (ODPS)

Champion: Jean-Georges Perrin

## Summary

Create a standard for data products.

Slack channel: https://data-mesh-learning.slack.com/archives/C08NYBH8YN5.

Jira: https://bitol-io.atlassian.net/jira/core/projects/ODPS/board?groupBy=status.

## Motivation

* Data products are not normalized.
* Various standards are emerging and are competing: they are not following open processes & foundations.
* They are not leveraging ODCS.

## Design and examples

### Principle
A data product should be able to evolve, hence include several versions of a data artifact (dataset or other), which can have multiple versions. Each version is governed by a data contract.

* Keep the philosophy of ODCS (`kind`, `apiVersion`, reusable blocks like `team`, `channels`, etc.).
* YAML by default (that's not a big deal, it's more to explain and use that as the reference schema).
* The ability to have multiple artifacts & versions/outputports.

## Draft of the standard

This section represents the draft of the standard, level of headers will need to be adjusted.

### Introduction

The Open Data Product Standard YAML file serves as the primary configuration and documentation for data products within our organization. This document explains each section of the standard, its purpose, and how to properly write it.

### Fundamentals

The core metadata section defines the fundamental identifying information required for the data product.

#### Example

```yaml
apiVersion: 1.0.0
kind: DataProduct

name: Customer Data Product
id: fbe8d147-28db-4f1d-bedf-a3fe9f458427
domain: seller
status: draft
tenant: RetailCorp

description:
  purpose: Enterprise view of a customer.
  limitations: No known limitations.
  usage: Check the various artefacts for their own description.

tags: ['customer']
```

```

#### Option B

Two variants: look at the `rawtransactions` and `consolidatedtransactions` `outputPorts`: they handle dependencies to input data contracts slightly differently.

#### Option C - Separate different versions into different output port instances.

Reasoning: simplify things, and support other metadata of an output port to also be different depending on the version.

# Questions:

* How do you link a specific version of an input port to an output port? through dependencies? at the SBOM level?
  * Suggestion, let the input port reference an output port upstream -- also provides implicit lineage across data products:
    ```yaml
    inputPorts:
    - name: inputtransactions
      outputPortReference: # unique reference to a specific version of output port
        domain: finance
        dataProduct: transactions
        outputPort: consolidatedtransactions
        outputPortType: table
        outputPortVersion: v1.0.0
    ``` 

### Endpoints
The endpoints section defines access points for the data product.

```yaml
endpoints:
- content: dictionary
  type: topic
  name: tpc-dict-update
  description: Kafka topic for dictionary updates
```

## Alternatives

### Option A0 (jgp)

### Back story
Cindy is a data engineer building a data product.

The two input data sources are identified by two data contracts, which IDs are `560525a6-0bd3-4aff-905f-39589c8c838e` and `341b02d1-5e52-4186-a20e-74ffc31997d2`. The output port is governed by another data contract identified by `af12347d-b730-48e5-a369-33a2c70fd95b`.

In the first iteration of the data product, Cindy wants the two data sources.

| Input id                             | Input version | Output id                            | Output version | Data Product version |
| ---                                  | ---           | ---                                  | ---            | ---                  |
| 560525a6-0bd3-4aff-905f-39589c8c838e | 1.2.0         | af12347d-b730-48e5-a369-33a2c70fd95b | 1.0.0          | 1.0.0                |
| 341b02d1-5e52-4186-a20e-74ffc31997d2 | 1.0.0         |                                      |                |                      |

This would result in:

```YAML
name: my data product
id: fbe8d147-28db-4f1d-bedf-a3fe9f458427
kind: DataProduct
apiVersion: 1.0.0
artifacts:
- name: Raw data 
  versions:
  - version: 1.0.0 # version of the data product
    in:
    - contractId: 560525a6-0bd3-4aff-905f-39589c8c838e
      version: 1.2.0
    - contractId: 341b02d1-5e52-4186-a20e-74ffc31997d2
      version: 1.0.0
    out:
    - contractId: af12347d-b730-48e5-a369-33a2c70fd95b
      version: 1.0.0
```

In a later iteration, Cindy wants a new version of `af12347d-b730-48e5-a369-33a2c70fd95b`, such as:

| Input id                             | Input version | Output id                            | Output version | Data Product version |
| ---                                  | ---           | ---                                  | ---            | ---                  |
| 560525a6-0bd3-4aff-905f-39589c8c838e | 1.2.0         | af12347d-b730-48e5-a369-33a2c70fd95b | 2.0.0          | 2.0.1                |
| 341b02d1-5e52-4186-a20e-74ffc31997d2 | 1.0.1         |                                      |                |                      |

Cindy wants to keep the two datasets available for some time, so ODPS will look like:

```YAML
name: my data product
id: fbe8d147-28db-4f1d-bedf-a3fe9f458427
kind: DataProduct
apiVersion: 1.0.0
artifacts:
- name: Raw data 
  versions:
  - version: 1.0.0
    in:
    - contractId: 560525a6-0bd3-4aff-905f-39589c8c838e
      version: 1.2.0
    - contractId: 341b02d1-5e52-4186-a20e-74ffc31997d2
      version: 1.0.0
    out:
    - contractId: af12347d-b730-48e5-a369-33a2c70fd95b
      version: 1.0.0
  - version: 2.0.1
    in:
    - contractId: 560525a6-0bd3-4aff-905f-39589c8c838e
      version: 1.2.0
    - contractId: 341b02d1-5e52-4186-a20e-74ffc31997d2
      version: 1.0.1
    out:
    - contractId: af12347d-b730-48e5-a369-33a2c70fd95b
      version: 2.0.0
```

### Option C0 (Tom De Wolf)

Currently you have as main structure for a data product a list of artifacts and within each artifact the in and out with respective data contracts on them. I would not do it like that. 
```
apiVersion: "v1.0.0"
kind: "DataProduct"
name: "Transactions"
id: "7ab7d0ff-d6cf-4310-80c6-81164f9c4a54"
version: "v0.1.0"
description:
  purpose: "All RetailCorp's transactions"
status: "active"
artifacts:
- name: "Raw transactions"
  versions:
  - version: "v1.0.0"
    out:
    - contractId: "c2798941-1b7e-4b03-9e0d-955b1a872b32"
      version: "v0.1.0"
  - version: "v2.0.0"
    out:
    - contractId: "c2798941-1b7e-4b03-9e0d-955b1a872b32"
      version: "v2.0.0"
- name: "Consolidated transactions"
  versions:
  - version: "v1.0.0"
    out:
    - contractId: "a44978be-1fe0-4226-b840-1b715bc25c63"
- name: "Full transactions with returns"
  versions:
  - version: "v0.3.0"
    out:
    - contractId: "ef769969-0cbe-4188-876f-bb00abadaee4"
```

I would rather explicitly put the input ports and output ports at the top level and an output port implicitly contains an artifact, and you avoid to have 2 versions which I don't get (version of artifact vs version of out):
```
apiVersion: "v1.0.0"
kind: "DataProduct"
name: "Transactions"
id: "7ab7d0ff-d6cf-4310-80c6-81164f9c4a54"
version: "v0.1.0"
description:
  purpose: "All RetailCorp's transactions"
status: "active"
inputports:
- name: payments
  title: "Payment Source System"
  contractId: "...."
  connectioninfo: ...
outputports:
- name: rawtransactions
  title: Raw Transactions
  versions:
  - version: "v1.0.0"
     contractId: "c2798941-1b7e-4b03-9e0d-955b1a872b32"
  - version: "v2.0.0"
     contractId: "c2798941-1b7e-4b03-9e0d-955b1a872b32"
- name: consolidatedtransactions 
  title: "Consolidated transactions"
  versions:
  - version: "v1.0.0"
    contractId: "a44978be-1fe0-4226-b840-1b715bc25c63"
- name: fulltransactionswithreturns 
  title: "Full transactions with returns"
  versions:
  - version: "v0.3.0"
     contractId: "ef769969-0cbe-4188-876f-bb00abadaee4"
```

Why? well, it could perfectly be that with the same input ports you produce multiple output ports. When having the input and output within an artifact, then you would duplicate the inputs in each artifact while in fact it could be a single implemented transformation writing to multiple output ports.

It also better aligns with the terminology and structure of a data product in the original data mesh book.

Another alternative is to consider different versions of the same output port as different entries in the list of output ports:

```
apiVersion: "v1.0.0"
kind: "DataProduct"
name: "Transactions"
id: "7ab7d0ff-d6cf-4310-80c6-81164f9c4a54"
version: "v0.1.0"
description:
  purpose: "All RetailCorp's transactions"
status: "active"
inputports:
- name: payments
  title: "Payment Source System"
  contractId: "...."
  connectioninfo: ...
outputports:
- name: rawtransactions
  title: Raw Transactions
  version: "v1.0.0"
  contractId: "c2798941-1b7e-4b03-9e0d-955b1a872b32"
- name: rawtransactions
  title: Raw Transactions
  version: "v2.0.0"
  contractId: "c2798941-1b7e-4b03-9e0d-955b1a872b32"
- name: consolidatedtransactions 
  title: "Consolidated transactions"
  version: "v1.0.0"
  contractId: "a44978be-1fe0-4226-b840-1b715bc25c63"
- name: fulltransactionswithreturns 
  title: "Full transactions with returns"
  version: "v0.3.0"
  contractId: "ef769969-0cbe-4188-876f-bb00abadaee4"
```

## Decision

TBD.

## Consequences

New standard, no impact on existing.
