# Open Data Product Standard (ODPS)

Champion: Jean-Georges Perrin

## Summary

Create a standard for data products.

Slack channel: https://data-mesh-learning.slack.com/archives/C08NYBH8YN5.

Jira: https://bitol-io.atlassian.net/jira/core/projects/ODPS/board?groupBy=status.

## Motivation

* Data products are not normalized.
* Various standards are emerging and are competing: they are not following open processes & foundations.
* They are not leveraging ODCS.

## Design and examples

### Principle
A data product should be able to evolve, hence include several versions of a data artifact (dataset or other), which can have multiple versions. Each version is governed by a data contract.

### Back story
Cindy is a data engineer building a data product.

The two input data sources are identified by two data contracts, which IDs are `560525a6-0bd3-4aff-905f-39589c8c838e` and `341b02d1-5e52-4186-a20e-74ffc31997d2`. The output port is governed by another data contract identified by `af12347d-b730-48e5-a369-33a2c70fd95b`.

In the first iteration of the data product, Cindy wants the two data sources.

| Input id                             | Input version | Output id                            | Output version | Data Product version |
| ---                                  | ---           | ---                                  | ---            | ---                  |
| 560525a6-0bd3-4aff-905f-39589c8c838e | 1.2.0         | af12347d-b730-48e5-a369-33a2c70fd95b | 1.0.0          | 1.0.0                |
| 341b02d1-5e52-4186-a20e-74ffc31997d2 | 1.0.0         |                                      |                |                      |

This would result in:

```YAML
name: my data product
id: fbe8d147-28db-4f1d-bedf-a3fe9f458427
kind: DataProduct
apiVersion: 1.0.0
artifacts:
- name: Raw data 
  versions:
  - version: 1.0.0 # version of the data product
    in:
    - contractId: 560525a6-0bd3-4aff-905f-39589c8c838e
      version: 1.2.0
    - contractId: 341b02d1-5e52-4186-a20e-74ffc31997d2
      version: 1.0.0
    out:
    - contractId: af12347d-b730-48e5-a369-33a2c70fd95b
      version: 1.0.0
```

In a later iteration, Cindy wants a new version of `af12347d-b730-48e5-a369-33a2c70fd95b`, such as:

| Input id                             | Input version | Output id                            | Output version | Data Product version |
| ---                                  | ---           | ---                                  | ---            | ---                  |
| 560525a6-0bd3-4aff-905f-39589c8c838e | 1.2.0         | af12347d-b730-48e5-a369-33a2c70fd95b | 2.0.0          | 2.0.1                |
| 341b02d1-5e52-4186-a20e-74ffc31997d2 | 1.0.1         |                                      |                |                      |

Cindy wants to keep the two datasets available for some time, so ODPS will look like:

```YAML
name: my data product
id: fbe8d147-28db-4f1d-bedf-a3fe9f458427
kind: DataProduct
apiVersion: 1.0.0
artifacts:
- name: Raw data 
  versions:
  - version: 1.0.0
    in:
    - contractId: 560525a6-0bd3-4aff-905f-39589c8c838e
      version: 1.2.0
    - contractId: 341b02d1-5e52-4186-a20e-74ffc31997d2
      version: 1.0.0
    out:
    - contractId: af12347d-b730-48e5-a369-33a2c70fd95b
      version: 1.0.0
  - version: 2.0.1
    in:
    - contractId: 560525a6-0bd3-4aff-905f-39589c8c838e
      version: 1.2.0
    - contractId: 341b02d1-5e52-4186-a20e-74ffc31997d2
      version: 1.0.1
    out:
    - contractId: af12347d-b730-48e5-a369-33a2c70fd95b
      version: 2.0.0
```

### Format

TBD.

## Alternatives

### Alternative Tom De Wolf

Currently you have as main structure for a data product a list of artifacts and within each artifact the in and out with respective data contracts on them. I would not do it like that. 
```
apiVersion: "v1.0.0"
kind: "DataProduct"
name: "Transactions"
id: "7ab7d0ff-d6cf-4310-80c6-81164f9c4a54"
version: "v0.1.0"
description:
  purpose: "All RetailCorp's transactions"
status: "active"
artifacts:
- name: "Raw transactions"
  versions:
  - version: "v1.0.0"
    out:
    - contractId: "c2798941-1b7e-4b03-9e0d-955b1a872b32"
      version: "v0.1.0"
  - version: "v2.0.0"
    out:
    - contractId: "c2798941-1b7e-4b03-9e0d-955b1a872b32"
      version: "v2.0.0"
- name: "Consolidated transactions"
  versions:
  - version: "v1.0.0"
    out:
    - contractId: "a44978be-1fe0-4226-b840-1b715bc25c63"
- name: "Full transactions with returns"
  versions:
  - version: "v0.3.0"
    out:
    - contractId: "ef769969-0cbe-4188-876f-bb00abadaee4"
```

I would rather explicitly put the input ports and output ports at the top level and an output port implicitly contains an artifact, and you avoid to have 2 versions which I don't get (version of artifact vs version of out):
```
apiVersion: "v1.0.0"
kind: "DataProduct"
name: "Transactions"
id: "7ab7d0ff-d6cf-4310-80c6-81164f9c4a54"
version: "v0.1.0"
description:
  purpose: "All RetailCorp's transactions"
status: "active"
inputports:
- name: payments
  title: "Payment Source System"
  contractId: "...."
  connectioninfo: ...
outputports:
- name: rawtransactions
  title: Raw Transactions
  versions:
  - version: "v1.0.0"
     contractId: "c2798941-1b7e-4b03-9e0d-955b1a872b32"
  - version: "v2.0.0"
     contractId: "c2798941-1b7e-4b03-9e0d-955b1a872b32"
- name: consolidatedtransactions 
  title: "Consolidated transactions"
  versions:
  - version: "v1.0.0"
    contractId: "a44978be-1fe0-4226-b840-1b715bc25c63"
- name: fulltransactionswithreturns 
  title: "Full transactions with returns"
  versions:
  - version: "v0.3.0"
     contractId: "ef769969-0cbe-4188-876f-bb00abadaee4"
```

Why? well, it could perfectly be that with the same input ports you produce multiple output ports. When having the input and output within an artifact, then you would duplicate the inputs in each artifact while in fact it could be a single implemented transformation writing to multiple output ports.

It also better aligns with the terminology and structure of a data product in the original data mesh book.

Another alternative is to consider different versions of the same output port as different entries in the list of output ports:

```
apiVersion: "v1.0.0"
kind: "DataProduct"
name: "Transactions"
id: "7ab7d0ff-d6cf-4310-80c6-81164f9c4a54"
version: "v0.1.0"
description:
  purpose: "All RetailCorp's transactions"
status: "active"
inputports:
- name: payments
  title: "Payment Source System"
  contractId: "...."
  connectioninfo: ...
outputports:
- name: rawtransactions
  title: Raw Transactions
  version: "v1.0.0"
  contractId: "c2798941-1b7e-4b03-9e0d-955b1a872b32"
- name: rawtransactions
  title: Raw Transactions
  version: "v2.0.0"
  contractId: "c2798941-1b7e-4b03-9e0d-955b1a872b32"
- name: consolidatedtransactions 
  title: "Consolidated transactions"
  versions:
  - version: "v1.0.0"
    contractId: "a44978be-1fe0-4226-b840-1b715bc25c63"
- name: fulltransactionswithreturns 
  title: "Full transactions with returns"
  versions:
  - version: "v0.3.0"
     contractId: "ef769969-0cbe-4188-876f-bb00abadaee4"
```

## Decision

TBD.

## Consequences
