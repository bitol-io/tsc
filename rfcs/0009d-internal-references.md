## Summary

We have a need to be able to identify the specific items within a data contract. 


## Motivation

> Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?
> How does it align with our guiding values?

## Design and examples

Original work and design was completed under RFC-0009b - however at the TSC 
2025-05-20 - Option B | Option A - neither approved. Json Pointers were too brittle given the array structure. JSON paths were too complex in writing them effectively. TSC decision was to continue looking for options. 

This RFC continues the search for the correct internal reference structure. 

## Alternatives

REJECTED:

[RFC-009b](./approved/odcs-v3.1.0/0009b-ref-internal-properties.md) Option A & Option B - JSON Pointers an JSON Paths 

## Decision

> The decision made by the TSC.

## Consequences

> The consequences of this decision.

## References

> Prior art, inspiration, and other references you used to create this based on what's worked well before.
